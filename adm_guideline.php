        </div>

<p>
A large number of parents are seeking admission to GEETHIKA CBSE SCHOOL Piduguralla. We would like to inform every parent that we have very limited seats available. As per the policy and directive of CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education), we have the following guidelines for admission. Even the department of education follows the same.<br><br>

<ul style="color: #111D5E;">
<li><i>The first priority is for siblings. Applications from siblings are more than twice the number of seats available.</i></li>
<li><i>The second priority is for children of our teachers and other staff members..</i></li>
<li><i>Priority for admission is also listed for alumni of our school. As you are aware, ‘GEETHIKA’ has been functioning since 2003. Children of the alumni group are also too many..</i></li>
<li><i>The next preference is for the nationally mobile group, including central services and other transferable services of India..</i></li>
<li><i>Now the government priorities admission for minorities from different states of India to promote national integration..</i></li>
<li><i>Applications for admission to KG to 9th are accepted as on availability of seats..</i></li>
<li><i>Admission will depend upon the vacancies likely to arise on account of withdrawal due to parent's transfer..</i></li>
</ul>
To have an effective teaching learning process, we maintain limited class strength. Considering the limited number of seats available, it is expected that those who seek admission will realize and understand the constraints the institution faces. The disappointment of not getting admission should not become a matter of unhappiness among parents.<br><br>
Admissions to Grades 2 to 9 are finalised based on performance in the written admission test conducted in the month of April/ May subject to vacancies likely to arise in the academic year. Exerting any influence for admission directly or indirectly will be a disqualification.
